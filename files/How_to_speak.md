# How To Speak by Prof. Patrick Winston

[MIT 2018 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)
from[Steven Maude](https://gist.github.com/StevenMaude/280eadc60938ce4b6960dc60e830662d)

## How to start

* Suggests not starting with a joke.
  * Audience isn't necessarily attuned to your mode of speaking.
* Start with an empowerment promise; what will the audience get from the
  talk.
* Audience should be focused on the speaker; no laptops or mobile
  phones.
  * People have one language processor; if that's distracted, makes it
    be more difficult to focus on the talk.
  * Distracts others around the person using the laptop/phone.
  * Distracts the speaker.

## Conveying ideas

* Cycle ideas several times.
  * Gives people chance to pick up the idea
* Fence off your ideas.
  * Distinguish from other people's ideas.
* Verbally punctuate points where people can pick up if they've stopped
  paying attention.
* Ask questions.
  * Not too difficult as no-one will answer, but not too simple.

## Time and place

* Mid-morning, e.g. 11 AM, is a good time to have lectures.
  * People aren't tired.
  * It's not right after a meal.
* Room should be brightly lit.
  * Avoid people wanting to go to sleep.
* You should check the room out before speaking.
* Don't want an empty room; use a smaller room if necessary.
  * Makes people wonder why they are there.

## Boards and props

* Chalk and boards are good for teaching.
  * Can use graphics easily.
  * Speed is similar to that at which people can absorb ideas.
  * Provides a target to direct your hands.
    * Avoid putting hands in pockets or behind your back.
* Props can be very effective; as in theatre.
* Prof. Winston thought the use of boards and props was also effective
  due to empathetic mirroring. Can "feel" yourself writing or
  interacting with props.

## Slides

* Slides are good for exposing ideas.
* But use with care.
* Don't read the slides.
* Don't stand far away from the slides; it means people have to
  continually switch where they look.
* Don't use silly clipart.
  * Pictures are good, but use simple to understand images that convey
    your ideas.
* Don't use background patterns; they make the slides harder to read.
* Laser pointers are bad.
  * Looking away from the audience and lose connection.
  * If you need to direct attention, use an arrow on the slide.

### Simplify slides

* Remove the need for the audience to not focus on the slides:
  * Remove most of the words.
  * Minimum font size needs to be large to be legible.
    * This also makes you remove more words. 
  * Remove any logos.
  * Remove the title; can convey the title.
  * Remove any clutter, e.g. even bullet points.
* Can print out slides on paper and look at them to see if there's
  enough space to them.
* Hapax legomenon: something that only appears once.
  * Can have a complex slide, but only do that once in a presentation.

## Informing people

### Inspiration

* For younger people, inspiration might be conveyed through a belief of
  the speaker that the audience can achieve something.
* For more experienced people, inspiration might be conveyed by a
  passion of the speaker about what they are doing.

### Promise

* Provide a promise upfront about what the audience will get out of the
  talk.

### Teaching people how to think

* Prof. Winston believes that storytelling teaches people how to think,
  in an educational context.
* Provide people with:
  * Stories they need to know.
  * Questions they need to ask about those stories.
  * Mechanisms for analysing those stories.
  * Ways of putting stories together.
  * Ways of evaluating how reliable a story is.

## Persuading people

### Exams

* People often fail verbal exams due to:
  * Not situating; not giving the context for their work fully.
  * Not practicing.
    * Need to practice with an audience that aren't experts in your
      work, and are unafraid to give you criticism.

### Job talks

* Demonstrate vision.
  * The problem is one that the audience cares about.
  * There is something new in your approach.
* Demonstrate that you've done something.
  * List the steps needed to achieve the solution to the problem.
 * You don't have long to demonstrate these: maybe five minutes.
* Contributions: demonstrate what you've added to the field.

### Getting "famous"

* You want to use these techniques to present your ideas so that they
  are recognised.
* Symbol, slogan, surprise, salient (one idea), story (tell how it
  works).

## How to stop

### Final slide

* Put collaborators at the start, not the end.
  * It can diminish your role.
* Don't use "conclusions", "questions?", "thank you", a web address etc.
* Contributions is perhaps better.

### Final words

* Telling people you've finished speaking.
* A joke can be a good way to conclude.
* "Thank you" is not; it implies the audience has stayed out of
  politeness.
* Examples from political speeches: finish with a call to action.
* Can "salute" the audience: express how much you value your time at a
  place.
