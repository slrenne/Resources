# Resources
Resources for Bayesian data analysis, causal inference, epistemology, and more.

## Statistical Rethinking course by Richard McElreath: 
Very didactical [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) on Bayesian statistics and causal modeling. Here it is the cours's [website](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023) (with slides and code), and here it is the [book](https://github.com/Booleans/statistical-rethinking/blob/3cfa2eee33ff3d0086d47f03bca098b5460d4531/Statistical%20Rethinking%202nd%20Edition.pdf).

## Bayesian Data Analysis
More mathematical approach to Bayesian statistics. Here is the [course](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/gsu2023.html)  held by Aki Vehtari (with links to videos), and the [book](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf). Here is the [page](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) by Andrew Gelman. 

## Bayesian workflow
Nice [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppKpwtGy8KQ) from Aki Vehtari also referencing to this [case study](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/casestudies/Birthdays/birthdays.html).
Workflow also discussed by McElreath in this [video](https://youtu.be/oHWNexYPFTY?si=DPIN-00f9kNR8wGL&t=1259) (here the [slides](http://talmo.uk/2024/slides/mcelreath.pdf))
                
## Causal inference and modeling:
* McElreath's [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNPYUVmY3NM ) on Causal inference (it is in some part included in Statistical rethinking 2023) 

Judea Pearl's work:
* Here it is foundational work [*Causality*](https://www.google.it/books/edition/Causality/f4nuexsNVZIC?hl=it&gbpv=1)
* Here it is his [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaPV1OSEpHw ) at PyData conference 
* Here it is one short book (you can [download](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/) all the chapters )  

Jonas Peters work is very interesting in bivariate cases
* Here it is a course he gave at the MIT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvrcyqcN9Wo (it is just part one, look for the remaining)
* Here it is the handout of the course https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/jonas_files/scriptChapter1-4.pdf 
* Here it is his book https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn?collid=books_pres_0&id=11283&fn=11283.pdf 
* Here it is his website with few resources https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/ 
* Here it is a web-version to jot down directed acyclic graphs http://www.dagitty.net/ 

## Stan
* A platform that allows you do statistical modeling https://mc-stan.org/ 
* Stan User guide https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/linear-regression.html 
* There is an official youtube [page](https://www.youtube.com/@stan3394)

Here a couple of presentation from Bob Carpenter (developer of Stan)

Form Micheal Betancourt
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSjsJg8fcwY
* he also has a very nice website (https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/) with tutorials

## Data visualization 
* nice introduction with some examples of bad graphs in the *Introduction to Data Science* textbook from Rafael A. Irizarry ([chapter 11](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/data-visualization-principles.html))
* Very nice and enjoyable [book](https://socviz.co) *Data Visualization. A practical introduction* by Kieran Healy.

                       
## Epistemology 
Three good videos from McElreath:
* [Science Is Like A Chicken Coop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8LqFO1dk-w)
* [Science as Amateur Software Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwRdO9_GGhY)
* [The Problem with Cultural Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez3o3uWRSyY)   

## Writing
Larry McEnerney from the University of Chicago writing program:
